# MONTY INTERPRETER WRITTEN IN C PROGRAMMING
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
## USAGE
- Usage: monty file (where <file> is the path to the file containing Monty byte code)
- The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
it executed properly every line of the file
it finds an error in the file
an error occured
